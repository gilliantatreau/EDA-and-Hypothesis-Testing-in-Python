# EDA and Hypothesis Testing in Python
Exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing on food production data.

Exporatory data analysis (EDA) represents steps made to summarize and contextualize a data set, using both graphical and statistical analysis. 

This study aims to explore the relationship between diet and the environment. 
It was designed to test the claim that plant-based diets are better for the environment than traditional ones with animal-products. 
The different diets tested were a vegetarian diet which includes some animal products (such as eggs, dairy, cheese, honey) but no meat or seafood, a vegan diet that excludes all animal products, and a traditional “animal-based” diet that excludes none of the food products.

From this data set, it is impossible to reject any of the null hypotheses. 
Across every environmental impact that was measured, there was no evidence that a plant-based diet (either vegetarian or vegan) was any better for the environment than the animal-based diet. 
This was concluded based on a non-parametric test (Mann Whitney U test) because no variable was normally distributed.
However, due to the limited size of the data, these findings are particularly implicative of the world at large, and have a rather limited scope.
